    <h2>Massage Therapy is a Vital Part of a Healthy Lifestyle</h2>
    <p>Jackie Wolf, BSIE, LMT founded The Stillpoint Therapeutic Massage Center for the purpose of contributing to the health and well being of each individual patient through massage therapy and body work.  Massage offers many benefits for the health of the human body with the use of clinical techniques. The Stillpoint therapists are able to help patients looking to relieve stress from their demanding lives as well as those who need to address physical issues.</p>
    <p>Through our gifts as trained and licensed massage therapists, we strive to provide professional and compassionate therapeutic, medical, sports or relaxation massage to each client that seeks our services. Our therapists are considered to have distinctly developed styles and techniques.  We constantly focus on being present with each patient and focus on creating a memorable and quality experience with consistent and compelling value.</p>
    <p>Our center is unique.  Patients have access to a team of therapists, over 25 years experience, different approaches and a multitude of skillsets.  Many of our patients see multiple therapists, who network internally and with the medical community when needed.</p>
    <p>It is with much gratitude that we have discovered the gift of massage therapy.</p>
