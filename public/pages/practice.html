      <h2>Therapies</h2>
      <h3 class="button1">CranioSacral Therapy (CST)</h3>
      <p class="toggle1">CST is a gentle, hands-on approach that releases tensions deep in the body to relieve pain and dysfunction and improve whole-body health and performance. It was pioneered and developed by Osteopathic Physician John E. Upledger after years of clinical testing and research at Michigan State University where he served as professor of biomechanics. Every day your body endures stresses and strains that it must work to compensate for. Unfortunately, these changes often cause body tissues to tighten and distort the craniosacral system. These distortions can then cause tension to form around the brain and spinal cord resulting in restrictions. This can create a barrier to the healthy performance of the central nervous system, and potentially every other system it interacts with. Fortunately, such restrictions can be detected and corrected using simple methods of touch. With a light touch, the CST practitioner uses his or her hands to evaluate the craniosacral system by gently feeling various locations of the body to test for the ease of motion and rhythm of the cerebrospinal fluid pulsing around the brain and spinal cord. Soft-touch techniques are then used to release restrictions in any tissues influencing the craniosacral system.</p>
      <h3>MyoFascial Release Therapy</h3>
      <p>Fascial tissue is a white membrane which wraps all muscles, all muscles bundles, muscle fascicles, and even every muscle fiber. It is perhaps no exaggeration to say that there is almost as much fascial tissue in a muscle as there are muscle fibers. Modern medical science, however, has largely ignored fascial tissue in the body, not understanding (or at least appreciating) the important role it plays in bodily health. It serves many functions, but for a therapist its function as a lubricant is most important. It allows everything it wraps, from muscles to muscles fibers, to slide over whatever is next to it. Over time, however, for reasons of physical and emotional trauma, habit patterns, disease, and the desiccation of tissue that can accompany the aging process, fascial tissue can get hard, rigid, short, gluey, and inelastic. In short, fascial tissue will change from a lubricant to an adhesive. This binding up of fascial tissue causes a great deal of what the patient experiences as stress, tension, and pain, and loss of ease and range of motion. The techniques you will experience in Myofascial Release Therapy are designed to lengthen, stretch, soften, make more supple, in short, to make elastic again, this all important tissue.</p>
      <h3>Precision NeuroMuscular Therapy (PNMT)</h3>
      <p>For every symptom a client may present, there are multiple possible causes. We concentrate on getting to the most likely source as efficiently as possible. PNMT is science based, not philosophically based. Many clinical research studies have been conducted relevant to this work. Since the causes for every symptom can be different, each client receives a session created exactly for them, rather than a routine or recipe. There is no shoulder routine, low back routine, or set of specific tests we do for every person who walks in our door (one size fits nobody). PNMT offers one of the most conservative approaches for chronic pain with the least risk of side-effects. It is often used by those unaware of its practice as a last resort, but in many cases it can save the individual  large amounts of time and money in the long run.</p>
      <h3>Lymph Drainage Therapy (LDT)</h3>
      <p>LDT is an innovative hands-on method of lymphatic drainage developed by Bruno Chikly, MD, DO. It has been created out of his award-winning research on the lymphatic system consistent with recent scientific discoveries. LDT is the first technique that enables practitioners to detect and palpate the specific rhythm, direction, depth and quality of the lymph flow anywhere in the body. With these skills, practitioners can practice Manual Lymphatic Mapping (MLM) of the lymphatic vessels. With developed listening skills LDT practitioners are able to use their hands to assess and enhance overall circulation as well as determine the best alternate pathways for draining stagnant body fluid (lymph, interstitial, synovial fluid, etc.). Lymph Drainage Therapy has been taught for almost 20 years years to about 10,000 therapists throughout the world.</p>
      <h3>Pregnancy Massage Therapy</h3>
      <p>Studies indicate that massage therapy performed during pregnancy can reduce anxiety, decrease symptoms of depression, relieve muscle aches and joint pains, and improve labor outcomes and newborn health. Massage therapy addresses different needs through varying techniques, one of which is called Swedish Massage, which aims to relax muscle tension and improve lymphatic and blood circulation through mild pressure applied to the muscle groups of the body. Swedish Massage is the recommended prenatal massage method during pregnancy because it addresses many common discomforts associated with the skeletal and circulatory changes brought on by hormone shifts during pregnancy. Pregnancy massage not only improves hormone regulation and nerve pain, but may also reduce the swelling caused by reduced circulation.</p>
      <h3>The Primal Reflex Release Technique (PRRT)</h3>
      <p>PRRT is a manual-therapy approach for evaluating and relieving musculoskeletal pain. PRRT is often able to accomplish in just seconds what joint mobilization and manipulation, trigger point therapy, and soft tissue and myofascial release can do over time. PRRT has been found effective in more than 80% of patients with painful conditions. How can it be so successful? PRRT is based on the premise that over-stimulation of the body’s primal reflexes creates pain and keeps painful patterns occurring again and again. These reflexes -- startle, withdrawal, and the protective joint reflexes--are hardwired into the nervous system of the body for the purpose of survival. When a person experiences a painful or startling event, these reflexes are triggered in an attempt to protect the body. Unfortunately, these reflexes often persist in a state of hyper-readiness long after the triggering event has passed. When sustained over time, activated reflex responses lead to patterns of pain that are reproduced, repeated, and maintained, interfering with healing and resisting therapeutic efforts to restore natural function.</p>
      <h3>Deep Tissue Massage Therapy</h3>
      <p>Is designed to relieve severe tension in the muscle and the connective tissue or fascia. This type of massage focuses on the muscles located below the surface of the top muscles. Deep tissue massage is often recommended for individuals who experience consistent pain, are involved in heavy physical activity (such as athletes), and patients who have sustained physical injury.</p>
      <h3>Sports Massage Therapy</h3>
      <p>The Stillpoint therapists treat athletes at all levels: High School, Collegiate, Professional, and Amateur.</p>
      <p>As an athlete, you train hard.  Maximum effort is required and does not come without a painful price. This pain comes from trauma - injury that is occurring or has already occurred to the affected muscle tissue.  Permanent microdamage occurs each and every time you play in pain and it will eventually have its effect as reduced mobility and possibly a shortened athletic career.</p>
      <p>Massage PREVENTS the repeated damage before it happens!</p>
      <p>Massage loosens muscle fibers, separating them from one another so they can act freely and with more flexibility.  Massage also helps lengthen muscles shortened by the frequent and hard contractions of athletics.  It eliminates fatigue, promotes relaxation, relieves swelling, reduces muscle tension and helps prevent soreness.  It can also speed recovery from injury.</p>
      <p>Athletes will benefit from sports massage whether you are sore or injured.</p>
      <h3>Swedish Massage Therapy</h3>
      <p>Uses five styles of long, flowing strokes to massage. The five basic strokes are effleurage (sliding or gliding), petrissage (kneading), tapotement (rhythmic tapping), friction (cross fiber) and vibration/shaking. Swedish massage has shown to be helpful in reducing pain and joint stiffness.</p>
      <h3>Reflexology</h3>
      <p>Reflexology is a non-invasive complementary practice involving the use of alternating pressure applied to reflexes within reflex maps of the body located on the feet, hands and outer ears.</p>
      <h3>SomatoEmotional Release Therapy (SER)</h3>
      <p>SER is a therapeutic process that helps rid the mind and body of residual effects of past trauma associated with negative experiences. The body often retains (rather than dissipates) physical forces, and often the accompanying emotional energy, triggered by physiological, psychological, emotional or spiritual trauma.  As the body heals, it can isolate or wall off this energy into what is called an “energy cyst”.  Although a body can initially adapt to the presence of this “energy cyst”, eventually the body weakens or tires of this accommodation and can develop symptoms of pain, dysfunction or emotional stress in response.</p>
